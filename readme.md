# Project Overview

This project consists of two parts, each focusing on different types of data analysis and prediction tasks using open datasets. The objective is to apply data science techniques for classification and time series forecasting, culminating in the preparation of Python files suitable for production deployment.


## Part 1: Classification Task

Choose an open classification dataset, perform comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing, visualize the data, and test various classification models. The best-performing model based on chosen metrics will be selected and prepared for production.


## Part 2: Time Series Forecasting Task

Choose an open multivariate time series dataset (non-financial) where the target variable does not exhibit seasonality. Predict 100 future time instants, starting from a point where the regressor variables' future values are unavailable.
